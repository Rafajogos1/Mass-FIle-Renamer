# Mass-File-Renamer
A mass file renamer that I'm developing to hone my skills in Python. Done in console as I considered a blind parent while doing this.

## Current renaming modes
### Replace mode
This mode replaces text present in the file name with another text written by the user.
### Prefix mode
This mode adds text to the beginning of the file name. It works either with all the files or only those containing a certain text.
### Suffix mode
This mode adds text to the ens of the file name. It works either with all the files or only those containing a certain text.
### Remove mode
This mode removes the text written by the user from the file name.
